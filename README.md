# TFT Talents
TFT was the precursor to GURPS. Friends of mine still play it extensively, and have worked on expanding it a great deal, which includes a great deal many new talents, and modifications to existing ones. I put them in a json file, and use that file to create on the fly talent filtering.

This repo's here to version control as new talents are added, and existing ones are modified, and to open it up to anybody else who might be interested in using it.
